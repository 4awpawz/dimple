Incremental Build Steps to run with or without the assistance of file watcher

1.1 generate a stats list containing all the files in the user's source folder
{we now have a stats file}
1.3 use stats file to resolve the fragment and include files to use to generate the site's pages
1.2 generate a list of all stale files by filtering the files referenced in the stats list, comparing each file's mod date to the cached stats' file mod date or if the cached stats file doesn't exist marking all of them as stale 
{we now have a list of all stale files}
1.4 generate the site's pages using the resolved fragments and includes
1.5 create a map containing each item in the generated stats list
1.6 read the cached stats file if there is one
1.7 if the cached ststs file exists, for each item in the cached stats file that doesn't exist in the newly generated stats list, delete its corresponding page from the user's public folder 
1.8 save the newly generated stats file to the .cahce folder
