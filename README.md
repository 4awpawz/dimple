# Welcome to Trio

Trio is a simple to use static website generator built with Node.js. It reflects its author's desire to rely exclusively upon the three pillars of the web - *HTML*, *JavaScript* and *CSS* - along with *YAML front matter* and with the *least amount of configuration necessary*, to create static websites.

As such Trio is somewhat opinionated but if you love working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript then you just might love creating static websites with it. 

This isn't just la di da!
